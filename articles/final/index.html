        <p id="intro-text">In recent years, urban infrastructure planning has become a focal point of debates surrounding sustainable
            city
            living. One prominent discussion in Toronto is a proposal to remove bike lanes
            along
            Yonge, Bloor, and University Streets. These streets are central to the city's downtown core and serve as
            vital
            thoroughfares for commuters, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. The removal of bike lanes raises questions
            about
            its potential impact on the neighborhoods these streets traverse, including changes to commute patterns,
            accessibility, and the quality of life for residents.
            This article explores the characteristics of the neighborhoods directly affected by the proposed
            changes using data from the 2021 Census, sourced from the City of Toronto’s open data portal. By analyzing
            demographics, commute patterns, and socio-economic factors, this analysis aims to provide a data-driven
            perspective on the implications of this decision.

        <h1>Task Overview</h1>
        <p id="task-text">The primary objective of this project is to create a visualization-rich, interactive article to assess the
            impact of bike lane removal on affected neighborhoods. The article uses data visualization techniques to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Explore Demographics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Highlight age</li>
                    <li>Income</li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Work industry distributions across neighborhoods along Yonge, Bloor, and University Streets</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Search Neighborhoods</h2>
        <input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Search for neighborhoods...">
        <table id="neighborhoodTable">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th onclick="sortTable('name')">Name</th>
                    <th onclick="sortTable('population')">Population</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody id="neighborhoodList">
                <!-- Neighborhoods will be populated here by JavaScript -->
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p id="info-text">
            All visualizations were created using Python and interactive visualization library Chart.js. Data was
            preprocessed to ensure accuracy and clarity, with missing values handled through appropriate imputation
            methods.
            The article incorporates user feedback gathered through formative evaluations, ensuring the content
            resonates
            with its target audience.

        <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p id="conclusion-text">
            This site represents the beginning of a broader exploration into how Toronto’s bike lane infrastructure
            impacts
            its residents. The current visualizations provide valuable insights into neighborhood characteristics,
            cycling
            habits, and commuting trends, but this is just the first step.
            Future updates will incorporate sentiment analysis from social media platforms and Google search trends to
            capture a dynamic picture of public opinion.
            <br>By layering these insights with the existing data, the site will
            evolve into a comprehensive resource for understanding the interplay between infrastructure, policy, and
            community needs.
            Thank you for visiting and exploring this first draft. Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I work to
            refine
            and expand this project to better serve Toronto’s residents and urban planners.
